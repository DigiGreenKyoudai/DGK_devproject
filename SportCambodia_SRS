1.	Introduction

•	List and manage sport events that are conducted on these playgrounds.

The requirements analysis sets out in more detail the scope of the Sport Management System to be implemented, and the functional and non-functional requirements to be met, and the corresponding scope of data to be handled. 

Functional requirements concern with SportCambodia Website included in scope and the way they are designed to operate. Non-functional requirements cover aspects of service delivery such as backup and system accessibility.

6.	Dependencies on Existing System

ODOO Sales Management successful implementation depends on the existing system (automated and non-automated) in many way:
1.	Sales management process (leads, opportunities, quotations and sales orders), and organizational charts.
2.	All forms and reports produced by the current systems whether in a paper form or computer files (e.g. spreadsheets, databases, etc.) related to the Sales management four sub-modules. These files serve as inputs to ODOO system.
3.	Any relevant HR organizational regulations.

7.	Analysis of Existing System\

•	Using Excel sheet to manage the the sales. 
•	To make report, A2A is using excel sheet also to create report.
•	For resort product management, vKirirom use KIOSK third party application to manage. Worksheet for checking attendance of workers.
•	Difficult to track the previous records.
•	The KIOSK application produce wrong data and not accurate in daily report, so they decide to make their own daily record based on Excel sheet and print it out.
•	Not satisfy with the current system.
